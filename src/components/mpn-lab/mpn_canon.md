## 16. Seldon Crisis Detection

Crisis is indicated when:
1. **Baseline Degradation**: B(t) → 0
2. **Dissonance Spike**: D(t) > θ_D (typically 0.7)
3. **Arrhythmia Increase**: α(t) > θ_α (typically 0.5)
4. **P Sequence**: 3+ consecutive "P" (Parallel) neo-Riemannian operations

**Lead Time**: 15-30 minutes before visible cascade

## 17. Emergent Macro-Visualization (per RSCH-100)

For visualizing the **entire piece at once** as a Complex Adaptive System, we employ Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) coupled with Mean Field Game (MFG) Theory.

### The Psychohistory Engine Architecture

| Component | Mathematical Model | Visualization |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Population** | N heterogeneous agents | Particle swarm |
| **Field** | Probability density Φ(x,t) | Density heatmap |
| **Personas** | Distinct utility functions | Color-coded agents |
| **Emergence** | HJB + Fokker-Planck coupling | Field evolution animation |

### Agent Personas (Erika Network)

| Persona | Behavior | Field Effect | Color |
|---------|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Catalyst** | High volatility, seeks local maxima | Creates new attractor basins | 🔴 Red |
| **Stabilizer** | High friction, resists movement | Deepens existing probability wells | 🔵 Blue |
| **Synergist** | Moves toward high-density ∇m | Amplifies dominant signal | 🟢 Green |
| **Saboteur** | Seeks low-density, spreads entropy | Disrupts coherence | 🟣 Purple |

### Governing Equations

**Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (Individual Optimization):**
$$\partial_t V + H(x, \nabla V, m) = 0$$

**Fokker-Planck (Population Density Evolution):**  
$$\partial_t m - \nu \Delta m - \nabla \cdot (m \nabla_p H) = 0$$

**Coupling**: Agent decision depends on population density m, creating feedback loop (the "Zeitgeist")

### Probability Field Φ(x,t)

The global field represents "Organizational Health" or "Narrative Tension":

| Φ Value | Musical Equivalent | System State |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Φ > 0.8 | Consonant tutti | Harmony, alignment |
| 0.5 < Φ ≤ 0.8 | Mild dissonance | Normal tension |
| 0.2 < Φ ≤ 0.5 | Strong dissonance | Conflict zone |
| Φ ≤ 0.2 | Cluster/noise | Crisis, chaos |

### Implementation Notes

- Use WebGL particle system for 1000+ agents
- Density heatmap updates at 30fps
- Click to inject "Disruptions" (repellers) or "Incentives" (attractors)
- Real-time tracking of global alignment and system stress

## 18. Tonnetz Grid & Neo-Riemannian Torus

The **Tonnetz** (tone-network) provides a geometric visualization of harmonic relationships where every chord has a predefined position on a toroidal surface.

### Tonnetz Grid Layout

```
     F♯ — C♯ — G♯ — D♯ — A♯ — E♯
    / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
   D — A — E — B — F♯ — C♯ — G♯
  / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
 B♭ — F — C — G — D — A — E — B
    / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
   G♭ — D♭ — A♭ — E♭ — B♭ — F — C
```

### Neo-Riemannian Operations on Torus

| Operation | Movement | Example | Visual Path |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **P** (Parallel) | Minor↔Major | C→Cm, Am→A | Horizontal flip |
| **R** (Relative) | Relative key | C→Am, Am→C | Diagonal slide |
| **L** (Leading-tone) | Share 2 notes | C→Em, Em→C | Vertical slide |
| **PL** | Compound | C→E | Spiral path |
| **PR** | Compound | C→Cm→E♭ | Zigzag path |
| **LPL** (Tritone) | Crisis shift | C→D♭ | Full rotation |

### Chord Positions (Predefined)

```typescript
const TONNETZ_COORDS: Record<string, {x: number, y: number}> = {
  'C':  {x: 0, y: 0},   'Cm': {x: 0, y: 1},
  'G':  {x: 1, y: 0},   'Gm': {x: 1, y: 1},
  'D':  {x: 2, y: 0},   'Dm': {x: 2, y: 1},
  'A':  {x: 3, y: 0},   'Am': {x: 3, y: 1},
  'E':  {x: 4, y: 0},   'Em': {x: 4, y: 1},
  'B':  {x: 5, y: 0},   'Bm': {x: 5, y: 1},
  'F#': {x: 6, y: 0},   'F#m':{x: 6, y: 1},
  'F':  {x: -1, y: 0},  'Fm': {x: -1, y: 1},
  'Bb': {x: -2, y: 0},  'Bbm':{x: -2, y: 1},
  'Eb': {x: -3, y: 0},  'Ebm':{x: -3, y: 1},
  'Ab': {x: -4, y: 0},  'Abm':{x: -4, y: 1},
  'Db': {x: -5, y: 0},  'Dbm':{x: -5, y: 1},
};
```

### Torus Visualization

- Render as 3D toroidal surface
- Chord = bright node on surface
- Harmonic progression = glowing trail
- P/R/L operations = distinct colored paths
- Crisis (PLP) = full circumnavigation

## 19. Lorenz Attractor Phase Space (Experiment 6)

The **Lorenz Attractor** provides a beautiful chaos visualization for the system's dynamic state, with axes mapped to psychometric dimensions.

### Phase Space Axes

| Axis | Psychometric Dimension | Range | Symbol |
|------|------------------------|-------|--------|
| **X** | Trauma (Real intrusion) | 0.0 - 1.0 | R(t) |
| **Y** | Entropy (Disorder) | 0.0 - 1.0 | H(t) |
| **Z** | Arrhythmia (Irregular rhythm) | 0.0 - 1.0 | α(t) |

### Lorenz System Equations

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = \sigma(y - x)$$
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = x(\rho - z) - y$$
$$\frac{dz}{dt} = xy - \beta z$$

**Psychometric Mapping:**
- σ (sigma) = Sensitivity to trauma propagation
- ρ (rho) = Baseline excitability threshold
- β (beta) = Entropy decay rate

### Lyapunov Exponent (λ)

The **Lyapunov exponent** measures system stability:

| λ Value | State | Visualization | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------------|---------|
| λ < 0 | **STABLE** | Converging spiral | Healthy, predictable |
| λ ≈ 0 | **EDGE** | Periodic orbit | Critical threshold |
| λ > 0 | **CHAOTIC** | Butterfly wings | Seldon Crisis territory |

### Typical Values

```typescript
// Stable organizational state
const STABLE_ATTRACTOR = {
  lyapunov: -0.20,
  phase: { x: 0.3, y: 0.25, z: 0.15 },
  label: 'STABLE'
};

// Crisis threshold
const CRISIS_THRESHOLD = {
  lyapunov: 0.05,
  phase: { x: 0.7, y: 0.6, z: 0.5 },
  label: 'CRITICAL'
};

// Chaotic breakdown
const CHAOTIC_STATE = {
  lyapunov: 0.91,
  phase: { x: 0.9, y: 0.85, z: 0.8 },
  label: 'SELDON CRISIS'
};
```

### Visualization Technique

| Element | Implementation | Effect |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Trajectory** | Line strip with 500+ points | Flowing ribbon |
| **Current State** | Glowing sphere on trajectory | Position indicator |
| **Attractor Wings** | Semi-transparent mesh | Crisis zones |
| **Color Gradient** | Blue→Gold→Red by λ | Health indicator |
| **Trail Decay** | Alpha fade on older points | Temporal context |

### Integration with MPN

- **Low Trauma/Entropy**: Trajectory stays in single wing (stable orbit)
- **Rising Tension**: Trajectory begins crossing between wings
- **Seldon Crisis**: Trajectory traces full butterfly pattern
- **Resolution**: Trajectory collapses back to single attractor basin
