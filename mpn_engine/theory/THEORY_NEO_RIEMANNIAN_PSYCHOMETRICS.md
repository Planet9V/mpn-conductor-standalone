# The Geometries of the Unconscious: Neo-Riemannian Calculus as a Topographic Map of Psychometric Drift

**Abstract**
This paper proposes a formal mathematical framework for quantifying and sonifying the structural transformations of the human psyche under stress ("Trauma"). By synthesizing **Lacanian Psychoanalytic Tone** with **Neo-Riemannian Music Theory**, we demonstrate that psychological states can be mapped onto the **Tonnetz** (a toroidal lattice of harmonic relationships). We posit that "Trauma" is not merely an emotional amplitude, but a geometric operation that warps the "key signature" of the subject's reality. This framework, the **McKenney-Lacan Symphonic Calculus**, allows for the precise, audible rendering of latent psychological entropy.

## 1. Introduction: The Failure of Linear Metrics
Traditional sentiment analysis relies on linear polarity (Positive vs. Negative). This is insufficient for capturing the non-Euclidean nature of human trauma. A subject in deep grief acts differently than a subject in rage, yet both may score "-1.0" on a linear scale.

We propose a **Topological Approach**. The psyche exists within a harmonic space. Stability is defined not by "happiness," but by **Harmonic Proximity**. A healthy mind transitions smoothly between adjacent emotional states (e.g., C Major to A Minor). A traumatized mind, conversely, performs catastrophic "jumps" across the harmonic lattice, connecting disparate states in a way that generates structural dissonance.

## 2. The Operator of Trauma: $\mathcal{R}$
We define "Trauma" ($\mathcal{R}$) as the degree of curvature applied to the subject's narrative arc.

$$ \mathcal{R}(t) = \beta_0 + \sum_{i} w_i \cdot K_i(t) + \mathcal{N}(t) $$

Where:
*   $\beta_0$ is the narrative tension (inevitable linear decay).
*   $K_i$ serves as the discrete trauma kernel (keywords, events).
*   $\mathcal{N}(t)$ is the **Named Reality Distortion**, derived from high-fidelity entity observance (e.g., *Cognitive Dissonance*, *Threat Perception*).

## 3. The Neo-Riemannian Map
We map $\mathcal{R}$ directly to the three primary operations of the *Tonnetz* grid:

### 3.1 The $\mathbf{R}$ Operator (Relative)
*   **Definition**: Exchange of the root tone for the relative major/minor.
*   **Trauma Domain**: $\mathcal{R} < 0.3$
*   **Psychometric Equivalent**: *Melancholy, Reflection, Nostalgia.*
*   **Geometry**: Adjacent movement. The "shape" of the reality remains congruent, merely inverted in mood.

### 3.2 The $\mathbf{L}$ Operator (Leading-Tone)
*   **Definition**: Exchange of the leading tone. (e.g., C Major $\leftrightarrow$ E Minor).
*   **Trauma Domain**: $0.3 \le \mathcal{R} < 0.6$
*   **Psychometric Equivalent**: *Anxiety, Anticipation, The Uncanny.*
*   **Geometry**: A "slide" across the axis. The subject feels the ground shifting. The "Home" key is visible but unreachable.

### 3.3 The $\mathbf{P}$ Operator (Parallel)
*   **Definition**: Collapse of the third. (e.g., C Major $\leftrightarrow$ C Minor).
*   **Trauma Domain**: $0.6 \le \mathcal{R} < 0.8$
*   **Psychometric Equivalent**: *Grief, Depression, The "Shadow".*
*   **Geometry**: A vertical collapse. The structure stands, but the light has been extinguished. It is the sound of "realization."

### 3.4 The $\mathbf{PLP}$ Compound (The Catastrophe)
*   **Definition**: A compound operation executing a trajectory across the Tonnetz torus. (e.g., C Major $\leftrightarrow$ Db Major).
*   **Trauma Domain**: $\mathcal{R} \ge 0.8$
*   **Psychometric Equivalent**: *Psychosis, Dissociation, Ego Death.*
*   **Geometry**: Non-local travel. The subject has been "thrown" into a foreign reality. There is no harmonic path back to the origin without retracing the trauma.

## 4. Entropy as Time Dialation
While $\mathcal{R}$ governs space (Pitch), **Shannon Entropy ($\mathcal{H}$)** governs Time (Rhythm).
High cognitive load (Entropy) results in the fragmentation of time perception.

$$ \Delta T \propto \frac{1}{\mathcal{H}} $$

As disorder increases, note duration decreases asymptotically toward zero (the "trill" or "scream").

## 5. Conclusion
The McKenney-Lacan Calculus provides a deterministic method for identifying the "Sound of the Symptom." By listening to the generated score, the analyst can hear the precise moment the subject's structural integrity failed, offering a diagnostic tool far superior to text observation.
