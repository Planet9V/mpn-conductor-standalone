HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK

ACT I

SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter Francisco and Barnardo, two sentinels.

BARNARDO. Who's there?
FRANCISCO. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
BARNARDO. Long live the King!
FRANCISCO. Barnardo?
BARNARDO. He.
FRANCISCO. You come most carefully upon your hour.
BARNARDO. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
FRANCISCO. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold, and I am sick at heart.
BARNARDO. Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO. Not a mouse stirring.
BARNARDO. Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, the rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRANCISCO. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?

Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

HORATIO. Friends to this ground.
MARCELLUS. And liegemen to the Dane.
FRANCISCO. Give you good night.
MARCELLUS. O, farewell, honest soldier. Who hath reliev'd you?
FRANCISCO. Barnardo has my place. Give you good-night.
MARCELLUS. Holla, Barnardo!
BARNARDO. Say, what, is Horatio there?
HORATIO. A piece of him.
BARNARDO. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
MARCELLUS. What, has this thing appear'd again tonight?
BARNARDO. I have seen nothing.
MARCELLUS. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, and will not let belief take hold of him.

SCENE V. A more remote part of the Castle.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

HAMLET. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I'll go no further.
GHOST. Mark me.
HAMLET. I will.
GHOST. My hour is almost come, when I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames must render up myself.
HAMLET. Alas, poor ghost!
GHOST. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing to what I shall unfold.
HAMLET. Speak, I am bound to hear.
GHOST. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
HAMLET. What?
GHOST. I am thy father's spirit, doom'd for a certain term to walk the night.
HAMLET. O God!
GHOST. But that I am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul.
HAMLET. Murder?
GHOST. Murder most foul, as in the best it is, but this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
HAMLET. Haste me to know't, that I with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge.
GHOST. Now, Hamlet, hear. 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, a serpent stung me. But know, thou noble youth, the serpent that did sting thy father's life now wears his crown.
HAMLET. O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
GHOST. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast.
