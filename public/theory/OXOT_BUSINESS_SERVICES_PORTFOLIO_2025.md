# Priority Service Profiles

## Service 1: On-Premise Threat Intelligence

**Tier:** 🔵 Blue | **Readiness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Research:** RSCH-13

### Elevator Pitch
> "Enterprise-grade AI threat detection that never sends your data outside your network—because privacy isn't optional for critical infrastructure."

### The Problem
73% of enterprises cite data privacy concerns as the primary barrier to cloud-based threat intelligence. Critical infrastructure operators cannot send telemetry to external clouds due to regulatory and operational constraints.

### The Solution
OXOT's Agent Blue deploys as an autonomous on-premise system. It builds a local digital twin, ingests telemetry from historians, SIEM, firewalls, and Active Directory, and receives threat feeds from AEON Core—without ever sending customer data out.

### Why OXOT Wins
- **Only** autonomous on-premise solution with multi-agent AI coordination
- Competitors (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) require cloud connectivity
- OT/ICS native—not bolted-on IT security

### Financial Impact

| Scenario | Without OXOT | With OXOT | Improvement |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Mean Time to Detect | 280 days | 4 hours | 99% faster |
| SOC Analyst FTEs Required | 8 analysts | 3 analysts | 63% reduction |
| Annual Breach Cost Exposure | $4.45M avg | Avoided | Full avoidance |

**Estimated Annual Cost Savings:** $1.2-1.8M (FTE reduction + breach prevention)

### Integration Requirements
- Syslog/CEF input from existing SIEM
- API access to Active Directory
- Optional: Historian connectivity for OT environments
- Deployment: On-premise appliance or VM

---

## Service 4: Neural Physics Propagation Control

**Tier:** 🔵 Blue | **Readiness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Research:** RSCH-03, RSCH-04

### Elevator Pitch
> "Stop ransomware in 8 seconds, not 45 minutes—using epidemic math to isolate super-spreader machines before infection spreads."

### The Problem
When ransomware strikes, security teams struggle to prioritize containment. Which machines should be isolated first? Traditional playbooks don't account for network topology.

### The Solution
AEON's Neural Physics engine computes the spectral radius of the network graph in real-time. High-centrality nodes (super-spreaders) are identified and isolated within seconds, mathematically guaranteeing propagation extinction.

### Why OXOT Wins
- **Only** solution with formal mathematical guarantees on containment
- Competitors rely on heuristics; OXOT uses proven epidemic theory
- Sub-10 second containment vs. industry average of 45 minutes

### Financial Impact

| Scenario | Without OXOT | With OXOT | Improvement |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Containment Time | 45 minutes | 8 seconds | 99.7% faster |
| Machines Encrypted | 1,200 | 3 | 99.8% reduction |
| Single Incident Recovery Cost | $8.2M | $45K | $8.15M savings |

**Potential Cost Avoidance:** $8.15M per major ransomware incident

## Service 7: Real-Time Insurance Underwriting

**Tier:** 🟡 Gold | **Readiness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Research:** RSCH-26

### Elevator Pitch
> "Replace annual questionnaires with continuous risk assessment—premiums that adjust hourly based on actual security posture, not self-reported checkboxes."

### The Problem
Cyber insurers face catastrophic loss ratios (67% in 2024 per Swiss Re) due to information asymmetry. Annual questionnaires are point-in-time snapshots that don't reflect actual risk.

### The Solution
AEON's Cyber-Actuarial Engine (CAE) enables continuous, graph-based risk scoring. The AEON Risk Score (ARS) combines network topology risk, cascade probability, human factors, and real-time hygiene metrics.

> **Note:** OXOT provides the underwriting technology platform. Actual policy issuance requires partnership with licensed insurance carriers. OXOT does not directly underwrite policies.

### Why OXOT Wins
- **Only** platform combining psychometric (human) risk with network topology analysis
- 3.2× improvement in loss-ratio prediction vs. questionnaire-based underwriting
- Enables "Pay-as-you-Risk" policies that incentivize continuous improvement

### Target Partnership Model
- Technology licensing to insurance carriers and MGAs
- White-label integration into existing underwriting platforms
- Revenue share on premium volume

### Financial Impact for Insurers

| Metric | Traditional | With OXOT CAE |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Loss Ratio | 67% | 48% (projected) |
| Claims Volume | Baseline | -25% (hygiene incentive) |
| Pricing Accuracy Correlation | 40% | 82% |

**Estimated Insurer Value:** $15M per $100M book of business over 5 years

## Service 9: Cognitive Digital Twin (IR Optimization)

**Tier:** 🟡 Gold | **Readiness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Research:** RSCH-31

### Elevator Pitch
> "Predict when your SOC analysts will make mistakes—and intervene before they do. Model your defenders as carefully as you model your network."

### The Problem
No matter how sophisticated the technology, humans remain in the loop. Under stress, fatigue, and cognitive overload, analysts make errors that extend dwell time and increase damage.

### The Solution
AEON's Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) models individual defender skills, personality traits (OCEAN), and real-time state (load, fatigue, arousal). The system predicts decision quality degradation and suggests optimized actions before errors occur.

### Why OXOT Wins
- **Only** solution modeling human defenders as first-class entities
- Reduces incident response time by 35% in simulations
- Eliminates 62% of panic-induced misconfigurations

### Financial Impact

| Metric | Without OXOT | With OXOT |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Mean Time to Respond | 4.5 hours | 2.9 hours |
| Misconfiguration Errors | 23/quarter | 9/quarter |
| Analyst Turnover | 35%/year | 18%/year |

**Estimated Annual Savings:** $420K for 8-person SOC

---

## Service 11: Team Composition Optimization

**Tier:** 🟡 Gold | **Readiness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Research:** RSCH-38

### Elevator Pitch
> "Hire for team harmony, not just individual talent. Use psychometric orchestration to build security teams that perform like symphonies, not garage bands."

### The Problem
Traditional hiring focuses on credentials and experience but ignores team dynamics. Imbalanced teams fail: all dominance leads to conflict; all caution leads to paralysis.

### The Solution
AEON's "Chef" algorithm models teams as polyphonic ensembles using DISC×OCEAN personality tensors. The algorithm identifies optimal personality profiles for new hires by minimizing group dissonance while maximizing capability coverage.

### Why OXOT Wins
- **Only** solution with mathematical team dynamics optimization
- 38% improvement in team performance metrics (retrospective analysis)
- Reduces bad hire costs by 63%

### Ethical Considerations
- Data is gathered from publice sources such as socia media
- Actual personality assessments are voluntary and transparent
- Recommendations are advisory, not deterministic
- Compliant with EEOC guidelines for job-related assessments
- Full data privacy and consent protocols

### Financial Impact

| Metric | Without OXOT | With OXOT |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Bad Hire Cost (per hire) | $240K | $88K |
| Team Conflict Incidents | 3.2/quarter | 0.8/quarter |
| Time to Productivity | 5 months | 3.2 months |

**Estimated Annual Value:** $285K for 10-person security team
