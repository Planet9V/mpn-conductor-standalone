### Abstract
This paper adapts the fictional concept of the **Seldon Crisis** (Asimov) into a rigorous **Topological** construct within the McKenney-Lacan framework. We define a Seldon Crisis not as a political event, but as a **Phase Transition** where the Borromean Knot unlinks ($Lk \to 0$), causing the symbolic order (Governance/Compliance) to lose its grip on the Real (Physics/Operations). We propose a metric for the **Crisis Probability** based on network entropy and topology.

### 1. The Definitions
In *Foundation*, a Seldon Crisis is a sociopolitical convergence where the "dead hand" of the past cannot control the present.
In **AEON Cyber Psychohistory**, a Crisis is a topological failure.
*   **The Knot**: Stability ($Lk=1$).
*   **The Unlink**: Crisis ($Lk=0$).

### 2. The Phase Transition
Using **Percolation Theory**, we model the network as a lattice.
Let $p$ be the percentage of nodes compromised (or "dead" / unpatchable).
*   If $p < p_c$ (Critical Threshold): The infinite cluster does not exist. The network functions.
*   If $p > p_c$: A giant connected component of "Compromise" emerges. The Symbolic Order collapses.

### 3. Detecting the Crisis
The Seldon Crisis is preceded by specific markers:
1.  **Critical Slowing Down**: Variance in system metrics (latency, CPU) increases before the crash.
2.  **Decoupling**: The correlation between the " Dashboard" (Imaginary) and the "Logs" (Real) drops to zero. This is the **Psychotic Break** of the organization.

### 4. AEON Core Application: The Foundation Module
AEON monitors the **Correlation Coefficient** between Strategy and Reality.
$$ C(Strategy, Reality) $$
If $C < 0.5$, we are in a Pre-Crisis state. The "Law" (Symbolic) no longer describes the "Territory" (Real).
*   **Action**: Agent Blue forces a "Hard Reset" of the local truth, bypassing the corrupted central command if necessary (Edge Sovereignty).

### 5. Conclusion
A Seldon Crisis is inevitable in any complex system ($S \to \infty$). AEON does not prevent change; it manages the *transition* to a new topological stability, ensuring the organization survives the collapse of its old symbolic order.
