## Integration with Existing Systems

### Neo4j Node Integration Points

#### ThreatActor Node Extensions
```cypher
MATCH (ta:ThreatActor)
RETURN ta.name, ta.personality_profile, ta.mbti_type, ta.dark_triad_score, ta.disc_style
LIMIT 10
```

**New Properties**:
- `personality_profile`: JSON personality dimension scores
- `mbti_type`: Four-letter MBTI designation
- `dark_triad_score`: Composite trait score (0-100)
- `disc_style`: Primary DISC style (D/I/S/C)
- `enneagram_type`: Primary type number (1-9)
- `threat_motivation_vector`: Personality-based motivation analysis
- `vulnerability_indicators`: Type-specific vulnerability pattern list
- `attack_specialization`: Personality-aligned attack vectors

#### New Relationship Types
```cypher
(:ThreatActor)-[:HAS_PERSONALITY_PROFILE]->(:PersonalityProfile)
(:ThreatActor)-[:EXHIBITS_DARK_TRIAD_TRAIT]->(:DarkTriadTrait)
(:ThreatActor)-[:FOLLOWS_ATTACK_PATTERN]->(:AttackPattern)
  {pattern_type: string, psychological_motivation: string}
(:ThreatActor)-[:VULNERABLE_TO_RECRUITMENT]->(:RecruitmentVector)
  {vector_type: string, psychological_mechanism: string}
(:Insider)-[:HAS_PERSONALITY_INDICATORS]->(:PersonalityIndicator)
```

#### CognitiveBias Node Enhancements
```cypher
MATCH (cb:CognitiveBias)
SET cb.big_five_correlation = {...}
SET cb.dark_triad_correlation = {...}
SET cb.exploitability_by_threat_type = {...}
RETURN cb
```

## Usage Patterns

### For Threat Intel Analysts
```
Query: Threat actor personality profile prediction
Input: ThreatActor behavioral indicators
Process: Big Five scoring → MBTI type → Dark Triad assessment
Output: Personality profile, vulnerability vectors, attack specialization
```

### For Security Managers
```
Query: Team security risk assessment
Input: Team member personality profiles
Process: DISC style analysis → conflict prediction → security control effectiveness
Output: Team risk score, resilience assessment, intervention recommendations
```

### For Insider Threat Investigators
```
Query: Insider threat risk stratification
Input: Employee behavioral data, organizational context
Process: Enneagram motivation analysis → grievance assessment → escalation prediction
Output: Risk tier, intervention strategy, remediation plan
```

## Version Control & Updates

**Current Version**: 1.0.0 (2025-11-25)

**Update Schedule**: Quarterly review with new threat intelligence integration

**Maintenance Responsibilities**:
- Personality framework validation: Quarterly
- Threat correlation updates: Monthly
- Neo4j schema updates: As needed
- Documentation refresh: Annually

---

## Compliance & Ethical Considerations

### Privacy & Ethical Standards
- Personality assessments used only for threat prediction
- No discriminatory profiling based on personality type
- Individual privacy protection in organizational context
- Informed consent where applicable in real deployments

### Data Protection
- All personally identifiable information redacted in framework files
- Theoretical examples only, no real threat actor names in personality profiles
- Responsible disclosure of psychological vulnerabilities
- No detailed instruction for psychological manipulation

### Fairness & Bias Mitigation
- Multi-framework validation prevents single-framework bias
- Temporal tracking detects false positives
- Regular audit of framework assumptions
- Diversity representation in validation studies
