# PLACEHOLDER: McKenney-Lacan Psychometrics Calculus

**Status**: AWAITING REAL MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK
**Date**: 2025-11-26
**Note**: User will provide the actual McKenney-Lacan Calculus - a new branch of mathematics

---

## Current State

The files in this directory contain preliminary scaffolding that will be **REPLACED** with the real McKenney-Lacan mathematical framework when provided by the user.

### What We Have (Placeholder)
- `MCKENNY_LACAN_CALCULUS_v1.0.md` - Preliminary symbolic notation (TO BE REPLACED)
- `README.md` - Framework overview (TO BE UPDATED)

### What We Need (From User)
- The actual McKenney-Lacan Calculus mathematical foundations
- Formal definitions and axioms
- Derivations and proofs
- Applications to psychohistory and cybersecurity

## Integration Points Ready

The following enhancements are ready to integrate with the real calculus once provided:

| Enhancement | Integration Point |
|-------------|-------------------|
| E17 Lacanian Dyad | Dyad equations Λ(d,a) |
| E18 Triad Dynamics | RSI topology Τ(R,S,I) |
| E19 Blind Spots | Gradient detection B(O,x) |
| E20 Team Fit | Fit function F(p,T) |
| E21 Transcript NER | Extraction scoring E(transcript) |
| E22 Seldon Crisis | Probability P(crisis|t) |
| E23 Population | Aggregate forecasting |
| E24 Dissonance | Tensor D_μν |
| E25 Threat Actor | Personality inference chains |

## Action Required

When user provides the real McKenney-Lacan Calculus:

1. Replace placeholder mathematical notation
2. Update all enhancement files with correct formulas
3. Ensure consistency across the framework
4. Validate mathematical rigor

**NO DEVELOPMENT THEATER**: This placeholder acknowledges we're awaiting the real mathematics rather than pretending AI-generated formulas are the actual framework.
