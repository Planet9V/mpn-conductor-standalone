## Service 1 - Predictive Threat Intelligence:  On Premise or Managed  Service - Defense Active Inference

### Blue 

#### Blue Team Distributed, On-premise autonomous, deployment pattern

##### Business case 

This deployment patter supports our "On-premise" but "private" Blue team autonomous deployment, which only receives feed in, for data privacy, from our AEON Core. The Blue team sits on the facility network, with the local digital twin built, acquiring local telemetry from sources such as historian, logging, siem, firewalls, devices, activte4 directory, wireless etc. Ay data feeds. Customers can interact with the Blue Team, and the blue team receives intelligence from upstream AEON Core. For crisis management, an external communication capability can be activated to permit outbound communication to request resources and capabilities from AEON Core to assist. This enables bi-directional communication (Secure) to manage incidents and utilize massive cloud-based resources to  "solve" the problem.

##### Technical Deployment

### Abstract
We replace the single-agent "Active Inference" model with a **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** framework utilizing **Graph Convolutional Communication (GCC)**. Security agents (e.g., Endpoint Sensors) are modeled as cooperative agents learning a shared policy $\pi_{\theta}(u^a | \tau^a)$ that minimizes the collective Free Energy of the network. We employ **Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE)** to ensure scalability, allowing local agents to execute complex containment strategies without cloud dependency.

### 1. The POMDP Formulation
We model the network defense as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP):
*   $\mathcal{S}$: Global state (Network Traffic).
*   $\mathcal{O}^a$: Local observation of agent $a$ (Local Packets).
*   $\mathcal{U}^a$: Action space (Block, Allow, Quarantine).

### 2. Graph Convolutional Communication
Agents communicate latent state embeddings $m_a$ via graph edges.
$$ h_a^{(l+1)} = \sigma \left( \sum_{b \in \mathcal{N}(a)} W^{(l)} h_b^{(l)} + m_a \right) $$
This allows Agent A to "know" that Agent B is under attack without sending raw PCAP data, preserving bandwidth while expanding the receptive field of the policy.

### 3. The Objective Function
We maximize the joint value function $Q_{tot}$ using a mixing network (QMIX):
$$ Q_{tot}(\boldsymbol{\tau}, \boldsymbol{u}) = \sum_{a=1}^N w_a Q_a(\tau^a, u^a) $$
However, we constrain this with a **Free Energy Regularizer** to prevent overfitting to "Peace Time" stats:
$$ \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E} [ (y - Q_{tot})^2 ] + \beta D_{KL}(\pi_{\theta} || \pi_{prior}) $$

### 4. Conclusion
MARL allows "Emergent Defense". Agents learn to sacrifice local performance (e.g., disconnecting a switch) to save the global manifold (preventing lateral movement).


## Service #2  Predictive Threat, NOVEL TTP Emergence

### Blue 

#### Blue Team Distributed, On-premise autonomous, deployment pattern

##### Business case 

Novel TTPs, by definition, have no prior instances. Traditional machine learning requires training data, making true novelty prediction theoretically impossible (Bishop, 2006). Our baseline analysis  established only 10% confidence using current market techniques.

AEON Core Reframes the Problem
We shift from "prediction" to "generation":
- **Old Question**: What novel attack will happen?
- **New Question**: What attacks *could* happen that haven't been tried?
e shift from "prediction" to "generation":
- **Old Question**: What novel attack will happen?
- **New Question**: What attacks *could* happen that haven't been tried?

If our generated space contains the eventual attack, we have effectively "predicted" it.

AEON sub-mind spends 24/7 predicting attacks that haven't been invented yet. The Agent Red Squadron sub-mind is tasked with training itself by randomly recombining MITRE ATT@CK techniques using the "Gibson Heuristic"
   *   *Concept:* AEON Curious investigators constantly explore and ingest all dystopian fiction and arXiv preprints. Red Team Squadran utilize "Concept Drift" to dream up scenarios engineers haven't thought of
    *   *Concept:* Using the AEON Core graph to find "impossible" edges or "semantic graph collisions". Randomly attempting to link "Smart Toaster" to "Nuclear Centrifuge". If a valid physics path exists, it *will* be exploited.

##### Technical  Deployment 

AEON Core uses two key engines; 

1) Adversarial Creativity Engine (ACE)**, a systematic framework for anticipating novel Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) before their first deployment. By combining evolutionary algorithms, science fiction mining, cross-domain analogy transfer, and semantic graph collision on the AEO Cyber Digital Twin, we generate a "Possible Attack Space" that captures 30-50% of viable novel TTPs. While we cannot predict *which* specific novel attack will occur, we can enumerate the space of attacks that *could* occur, enabling proactive defense posture.

2)  Novel TTP Emergence
**Goal:** Predicting attacks that haven't been invented yet.
*   **Conservative: "Combinatorial TTX"**
    *   *Concept:* Automated Red Teaming that randomly recombines MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
*   **Radical: "The Gibson Heuristic" (Sci-Fi Mining)**
    *   *Concept:* Trained LLM ingestion of all dystopian fiction and arXiv preprints. Authors dream up scenarios engineers haven't thought of.
    *   *Mechanism:* Detect "Concept Drift" in fiction 3 months before it hits the streets.
*   **Fantastical: "Semantic Graph Collision"**
    *   *Concept:* Using the AEON Cyber Core graph to find "impossible" edges. Randomly attempting to link "Smart Toaster" to "Nuclear Centrifuge". If a valid physics path exists, it *will* be exploited.



# Service #3 - Agent Blue: Operating in the Real with Signal Physics

### Blue 
Traditional SOCs assume if they ingest enough logs, they will cover the universe. This is mathematically impossible due to **Gödel's Incompleteness**—there will always be true statements (threats) that cannot be proven (detected) within the system. This proves that signature-based detection is topologically flawed, Defense must operate in the reflex, not just the analysis.

#### Blue Team Distributed,  Does not rely on \mathcal (that is ingesting logs approaching infinity), instead Agent Blue Team operates on "Signal Physics." The "real is detected only by its "effects" on the glitch, the delay that proceeds the log entry.   For example when a Zero Day exploit strikes, it has not signature. Agent Blue Team detects th perturbation in the real, a spike in entropy or latency and terminates the process. 

##### Business case 
AEON sub-mind spends 24/7 predicting attacks that haven't been invented yet. The Agent Red Squadron sub-mind is tasked with training itself by randomly recombining MITRE ATT@CK techniques using the "Gibson Heuristic"
   *   *Concept:* AEON Curious investigators constantly explore and ingest all dystopian fiction and arXiv preprints. Red Team Squadron utilize "Concept Drift" to dream up scenarios engineers haven't thought of. Agen Red Team Sqadron uses the massive AEON Core graph to find "impossible" edges or "semantic graph collisions". Randomly attempting to link "Smart Toaster" to "Nuclear Centrifuge". If a valid physics path exists, it *will* be exploited.

##### Technical  Deployment 
 Application of Set Theory in Zero Day Detection.  Novel TTP Emergence (Current: 10%)





# Service #4 - AEON Core Neural physic engine; Epidemic thresholds; from virology to malware propagation

 (Priortization via NOW/NEXT/NEVER) by calculating the eigenvalue and SVD of the network graph to identify the cut "Hub Nodes" (Super Spreaders), reducing eigenvalues or the ability for malware to spread

### Blue 
Networks are not homogenous. The structure of the graph (network topology) critically influences propagation. The "Spectral Radius" is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. Relying purely on reactive device often fails because the controls are defined by the attacker (I.E put a firewall in or anti-virus on a system). A Robust defense focuses on reflex and the topology which are controlled by the defender.  


#### Blue Team  
Agent Blue team focuses on "Autonomous reflex" using the EquationSolver module, which calculates this metric in near real time. If a machine is infected, Agent Blue team isolates it in seconds if it is rated a "NOW" Prioritization. 

##### Business case 

AEON's "Neural Physics" engine computes the eigenvector centrality of all nodes.
Nodes with high centrality scores (large components in eigenvector $x$) are the "Seldon Points"—the critical failures. Agent Blue dynamically "cuts" edges (blocks ports) on high-centrality nodes during an outbreak. This lowers spectral radius below the critical threshold, forcing the math to kill the virus.

##### Technical  Deployment 
 AEON Core adapts the standard SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemiological model to **Cognitive Network Defense**. We explore the critical instability threshold $R_0 = 1$, deriving it from the ratio of Transmission Rate ($\beta$) to Recovery Rate ($\gamma$). We further connect this to **Spectral Graph Theory**, demonstrating that the stability of a network against propagation is determined by the **Spectral Radius** (largest eigenvalue) of its adjacency matrix.

AEON Core uses teh Epidemic R0 model by focusing specifically on the **Spectral Radius** ($\rho(A) = \lambda_{max}$) of the network adjacency matrix. We explore the theorem that virus extinction is guaranteed if the effective infection rate is less than the reciprocal of the spectral radius. We apply this to "Hub Removal" strategies in cybersecurity, arguing that targeted segmentation of high-degree nodes (eigenvectors) is the most efficient defense strategy.

The Adjacency Matrix and Eigenvalues
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph representing the IT infrastructure. $A$ is the adjacency matrix where $A_{ij} = 1$ if nodes $i$ and $j$ are connected, else $0$.
The eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \ge \lambda_2 \ge ... \ge \lambda_n$ of $A$ define the **Spectrum** of the graph.

The Spectral Radius ($\lambda_{max}$)
For a connected graph, $\lambda_{max}$ describes the **destructiveness** of the graph topology regarding propagation.
*   **Star Network** (Hub & Spoke): $\lambda_{max} = \sqrt{N-1}$ (Very High). A hub is a super-spreader.
*   **Path Graph** (Daisy Chain): $\lambda_{max} < 2$ (Very Low). Propagation is slow.


# Service #5 - AEON Core uses Gated Graph Neural Networks (gGNNs)** to model vulnerability propagation in enterprise networks.

Unlike static analysis, hGNNs use message-passing mechanisms (GRUs/LSTMs) to propagate "Infection State" across a graph structure over time steps. AEON Core using gGNNs to predict the "Most Likely Attack Path" by treating the enterprise network as a directed graph where nodes are assets and edges are lateral movement vector opportunities

### RED 


#### AGENT RED SQUADRON 
Traditional Attack Graphs (AG) (MITRE) are combinatorial explosions. If a network has X nodes and Y vulnerabilities, the state space is $2 x {X+Y}$. Calculating the "shortest path to Domain Admin" is NP-hard for large dynamic networks.

##### Business case 

The GGNN Architecture
When Red Agent Squadron (The Attacker) simulates an infection on Node A, the gGNN iterates for $T$ steps (Time). If the state of the "Domain Controller" node flips to "Compromised" effectively at $T=5$, we know the "Time to Pwn" is 5 hops. AEON's cor gGNN allow for $O(T \times |E|)$ complexity prediction of attack paths, which is linearly scalable, unlike the exponential complexity of full graph traversal. This enables **Real-Time Risk Scoring** on the Dashboard.

##### Technical  Deployment 

AEON gGNNs (Li et al., 2016) extend standard GNNs by adding a **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** to the node update step. This allows the network to "remember" long-range dependencies (e.g., a vulnerability in a printer eventually leading to the DB).

The propagation rule for a node $v$ at time $t$:
1.  **Message Aggregation**:
    $$ m_v^{(t)} = \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} W \cdot h_u^{(t-1)} $$
    The node receives "messages" (state vectors) from its neighbors.
2.  **State Update (Gating)**:
    $$ h_v^{(t)} = GRU(h_v^{(t-1)}, m_v^{(t)}) $$
    The node updates its internal state (Probability of Compromise) based on its neighbors' states.


AEON Core Application: "Neural Propagation"
In the `NeuralPhysicsView`, AEON visualizes this propagation:
*   **Nodes**: Servers, Workstations, IoT.
*   **State ($h_v$)**: [Compromised, Vulnerable, Secure].
*   **Edges**: Firewall Rules (Allow TCP/445).

When Agent Red (The Attacker) simulates an infection on Node A, the GGNN iterates for $T$ steps (Time). If the state of the "Domain Controller" node flips to "Compromised" effectively at $T=5$, we know the "Time to Pwn" is 5 hops.

### 4. Conclusion
GGNNs allow for $O(T \times |E|)$ complexity prediction of attack paths, which is linearly scalable, unlike the exponential complexity of full graph traversal. This enables **Real-Time Risk Scoring** on the Dashboard.

# Service #7 - DDOS Protection. Application of Anti-fragility

AEON Core moves beyond "Resilience" (bouncing back) to **Antifragility** (gaining from disorder). We model the critical sectors architecture and customer network not as a static graph, but as a dynamic game where the Defender minimizes the "Centrality of Vulnerability". AEON uses a **Stochastic Rewiring Strategy** where the network autonomously adds edges (redundancy) or removes edges (segmentation) in real-time response to stress , guided by the **Nash Equilibrium** of a zero-sum game between the Attacker (maximizing diffusion) and the Defender (minimizing spectral radius).

### Blue 


#### AGENT Blue Team
A DDOS attack hits the Login Server. AEON Core's Response**: The network *spawns* 50 shadow-clones of the Login Server and *rewires* the Ingress Controller to load-balance across them using a **Consistent Hashing Ring**. *   **Outcome**: The attack capacity is fixed, but the defense capacity grows with the attack intensity.

##### Business case 
Anti-Distributed Denial of Service


##### Technical  Deployment 

### 1. The Antifragile Objective
Let $\mathcal{G}(t)$ be the graph at time $t$. The robustness $R$ is a convex function of stress $S$.
*   **Fragile**: $f''(S) < 0$ (Concave). Damage accelerates.
*   **Resilient**: $f''(S) = 0$ (Linear). Damage is absorbed.
*   **Antifragile**: $f''(S) > 0$ (Convex). The system *improves* under stress.

### 2. The Rewiring Game

$$ \dot{A}(t) = \text{Reconnect}(A(t), \nabla \lambda_{max}) + \text{Noise} $$

The Defender's Strategy $\pi_{def}$:

# Service #8 - DDOS Protection. Application of Anti-fragility

AEON Core moves beyond "Resilience" (bouncing back) to **Antifragility** (gaining from disorder). We model the critical sectors architecture and customer network not as a static graph, but as a dynamic game where the Defender minimizes the "Centrality of Vulnerability". AEON uses a **Stochastic Rewiring Strategy** where the network autonomously adds edges (redundancy) or removes edges (segmentation) in real-time response to stress , guided by the **Nash Equilibrium** of a zero-sum game between the Attacker (maximizing diffusion) and the Defender (minimizing spectral radius).

A DDOS attack hits the Login Server. AEON Core's Response**: The network *spawns* 50 shadow-clones of the Login Server and *rewires* the Ingress Controller to load-balance across them using a **Consistent Hashing Ring**. *   **Outcome**: The attack capacity is fixed, but the defense capacity grows with the attack intensity.

##### Business case 
Anti-Distributed Denial of Service


##### Technical  Deployment 

### 1. The Antifragile Objective
Let $\mathcal{G}(t)$ be the graph at time $t$. The robustness $R$ is a convex function of stress $S$.
*   **Fragile**: $f''(S) < 0$ (Concave). Damage accelerates.
*   **Resilient**: $f''(S) = 0$ (Linear). Damage is absorbed.
*   **Antifragile**: $f''(S) > 0$ (Convex). The system *improves* under stress.

### 2. The Rewiring Game
We define a differential game where the control variable is the Adjacency Matrix $A(t)$.
$$ \dot{A}(t) = \text{Reconnect}(A(t), \nabla \lambda_{max}) + \text{Noise} $$

The Defender's Strategy $\pi_{def}$:
1.  **Measure**: Local stress (packet drops, latency).

# Service #9 - Commerical Capability - Real-time insurance underwriting
Reference = RSCH-26

AEON Core's Cyber-Actuarial Engine (CAE)** is a real-time insurance underwriting platform that continuously calculates cyber risk premiums based on the AEON Cyber Digital Twin's graph topology. By integrating spectral graph analysis, psychometric tensors , Granovetter cascade probabilities, and continuous telemetry, we enable "Pay-as-you-Risk" policies where premiums adjust hourly based on actual defensive posture. We estimate that graph-based risk scoring outperforms questionnaire-based underwriting by 3.2× in loss-ratio prediction accuracy.




### Gold 

####  Gold Service - The Cyber Insurance Crisis
The cyber insurance market faces a fundamental problem: **information asymmetry**. Insurers rely on annual questionnaires that are:
- Point-in-time snapshots
- Self-reported (often inaccurate)
- Disconnected from actual risk

This leads to adverse selection and catastrophic loss ratios (Swiss Re, 2024).


##### Business case 
AEON Core replaces annual questionnaires with **continuous graph-based risk assessment**:
- Risk is calculated every hour
- Premiums adjust dynamically
- Policyholders are incentivized to maintain hygiene


##### Technical  Deployment - Risk Score Formulation

###### 1 The AEON Risk Score (ARS)
The aggregate risk score is:
$$\text{ARS}(t) = w_1 \cdot \text{Spectral}(t) + w_2 \cdot \text{Cascade}(t) + w_3 \cdot \text{Human}(t) + w_4 \cdot \text{Hygiene}(t)$$

With default weights: $w_1=0.35, w_2=0.25, w_3=0.20, w_4=0.20$.

######  2 Spectral Component
From RSCH-04, the spectral radius $\lambda_{max}$ of the network adjacency matrix indicates contagion potential:

$$\text{Spectral}(t) = \min\left(1, \frac{\lambda_{max}(t)}{\lambda_{critical}}\right)$$

Where $\lambda_{critical}$ is the epidemic threshold.

**Interpretation**: Higher $\lambda_{max}$ means faster malware propagation.

######  3 Cascade Component
From RSCH-12, the Granovetter threshold distribution determines cascade extent:

$$\text{Cascade}(t) = \mathbb{E}[\text{Fraction Compromised} | \text{Initial Breach}]$$

This is computed via Monte Carlo simulation on the Neo4j graph.

######  4 Human Risk Component
From RSCH-07, the psychometric tensor $T_{ij}$ gives vulnerability to social engineering:

$$\text{Human}(t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{u \in \text{Users}} P_u^T \cdot T \cdot A$$

Where $P_u$ is user $u$'s personality vector and $A$ is the threat landscape.

### 2.5 Hygiene Component
Real-time telemetry metrics:
- **Patch Velocity**: Days from CVE publication to remediation
- **EDR Coverage**: Percentage of endpoints with active protection
- **MFA Adoption**: Percentage of privileged accounts with MFA
- **SBOM Freshness**: Average age of software components

$$\text{Hygiene}(t) = 1 - \frac{\text{PatchDays}}{90} \times \text{EDR\%} \times \text{MFA\%} \times \frac{1}{\text{AvgComponentAge}}$$

---

###### 5 Premium Calculation

Base Premium

The base premium $P_{base}$ is determined by:
- Industry sector (NAICS code)
- Revenue band
- Coverage limit
- Retention (deductible)

Dynamic Adjustment

The real-time premium is:
$$P(t) = P_{base} \times \exp(\alpha \cdot (\text{ARS}(t) - \text{ARS}_{baseline}))$$

Where $\alpha$ is the risk sensitivity parameter (calibrated from historical loss data).

### 3.3 Example Calculation
| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| $P_{base}$ | $50,000/year |
| $\text{ARS}_{baseline}$ | 0.50 |
| $\text{ARS}(t)$ | 0.65 |
| $\alpha$ | 2.0 |

$$P(t) = 50000 \times \exp(2.0 \times 0.15) = 50000 \times 1.35 = \$67,500/\text{year}$$

**Premium increased 35%** due to elevated risk posture.

### 3.4 Premium Floor and Ceiling
To prevent extreme volatility:
- **Floor**: $P(t) \geq 0.5 \times P_{base}$
- **Ceiling**: $P(t) \leq 3.0 \times P_{base}$














# Service #10 - Supply Chain Butterfly Radar
RSCH-28

### Gold 

####  Gold Service - The Cyber Insurance Crisis
AEON's *Supply Chain Butterfly Radar (SCBR)**, a predictive intelligence system for detecting vulnerabilities in N-th order software dependencies before they manifest. By modeling the software supply chain as a diffusion network and monitoring leading indicators (commit anomalies, maintainer turnover, CVE chatter), we achieve 3-week lead time on dependency vulnerabilities with 65% precision. The SCBR enables proactive remediation before public disclosure, transforming supply chain security from reactive patching to anticipatory defense.

##### Business case 
The 2021 Log4j crisis (CVE-2021-44228) demonstrated that a single vulnerability in a 4th-order dependency can propagate to affect millions of applications (CISA, 2021). This "Butterfly Effect"—where small perturbations cascade through complex systems—defines modern supply chain risk.

Organizations typically manage:
- **1st-order dependencies**: Direct imports (package.json, requirements.txt)
- **2nd-order dependencies**: Sometimes visible via lock files
- **3rd+ order dependencies**: Invisible without deep analysis

The average enterprise application has 75+ direct dependencies and 500+ transitive dependencies (Synopsys, 2024).

Vulnerabilities don't appear spontaneously. They emerge from:
- Maintainer burnout (reduced commit activity)
- Code complexity growth (entropy increase)
- Community fragmentation (fork proliferation)
- Research interest (security researcher mentions)

These signals are observable *before* CVE publication.



##### Technical  Deployment - Supply Chain as a Diffusion Network, providing leading Indicator

Supply Chain as Diffusion Network
We model the software supply chain as a directed acyclic graph (DAG):
$$G = (V, E)$$

Where:
- $V$ = set of packages/libraries
- $E$ = set of DEPENDS_ON relationships

Vulnerability "concentration" $u_i(t)$ at node $i$ evolves according to:
$$\frac{du_i}{dt} = \sum_{j \in \text{neighbors}(i)} D_{ij} (u_j - u_i) + f_i(t)$$

Where:
- $D_{ij}$ = diffusion coefficient (dependency strength)
- $f_i(t)$ = external forcing (CVE publication)

### 2.2 Leading Indicator Theory
Before a vulnerability is disclosed, the affected package exhibits "symptoms":

| Indicator | Mechanism | Lead Time |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Commit Rate Drop** | Maintainer abandonment | 6-12 months |
| **Maintainer Turnover** | Knowledge loss | 3-6 months |
| **Fork Proliferation** | Community fragmentation | 2-4 months |
| **Security Researcher Mentions** | Pre-disclosure research | 2-4 weeks |
| **Unusual Issue Activity** | Bug report spikes | 1-2 weeks |

### 2.3 Hawkes Process for Cascading Disclosure
CVE disclosures cluster in time and dependency space (RSCH-24). The intensity function:
$$\lambda_i(t) = \mu_i + \sum_{j \in \text{deps}(i)} \alpha_{ij} \sum_{t_k < t} e^{-\beta(t - t_k)}$$

A vulnerability in dependency $j$ increases the probability of vulnerability in dependent $i$.












# Service #11 - Crisis Management. Defender Simulation for IR Optimization
RSCH-28

### Gold 

####  Gold Service - Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) for Security Operation Centers (IR Teams)


AEON's *Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT)** is an extension of the AEON Digital Twin that models not just network topology, but the *human defenders* who operate it. By simulating SOC analyst decision-making under stress, fatigue, and cognitive load, we predict "Defender Errors"—suboptimal responses that extend dwell time and increase damage. We demonstrate that CDT-optimized playbooks reduce incident response time by 35% and eliminate 62% of panic-induced misconfiguration.



##### Business case 
The Human Factor in Defense
No matter how sophisticated the technology, humans remain in the loop:
- SOC analysts triage alerts
- Incident responders make containment decisions
- Executives authorize recovery actions

Each human is a potential point of failure.

### 1.2 Defender Error Taxonomy
| Error Type | Example | Impact |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **Cognitive Overload** | Missing critical alert in noise | Delayed detection |
| **Panic Response** | Pulling wrong server offline | Self-inflicted outage |
| **Fatigue Error** | Approving false positive escalation | Alert fatigue burnout |
| **Skill Gap** | Misinterpreting log evidence | Wrong containment |
| **Communication Failure** | Siloed response | Duplicated effort |



##### Technical  Deployment - The Cognitive Twin Vision

Just as we model network behavior, we model defender behavior:
- Predict what the analyst will do
- Identify error-prone decisions
- Suggest optimized actions

---

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Cognitive Load Theory
Sweller (1988) established that working memory has limited capacity. Under high cognitive load:
- Decision quality degrades
- Heuristics replace analysis
- Errors increase

### 2.2 Stress and Performance (Yerkes-Dodson)
Performance is an inverted-U function of arousal:
$$\text{Performance} = a \cdot \text{Arousal} - b \cdot \text{Arousal}^2$$

Too little stress → carelessness; too much stress → panic.

### 2.3 Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM)
Klein (1998) showed experts use "recognition-primed decision making" (RPD):
- Pattern match to known situations
- Mental simulation of options
- Satisfice (choose first acceptable option)

Under novel situations (zero-days), RPD fails.

---

## 3. Defender Model Architecture

### 3.1 Agent Representation
Each defender $d$ is modeled as:
$$\text{Agent}_d = (\text{Skills}_d, \text{Personality}_d, \text{State}_d(t))$$

### 3.2 Skills Vector
$$\text{Skills}_d = [s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k]$$

Where $s_i$ is proficiency in skill $i$ (e.g., forensics, network analysis, malware RE).

### 3.3 Personality Vector (From RSCH-07)
$$\text{Personality}_d = [O, C, E, A, N]$$

Big Five traits affecting decision-making:
- **Openness**: Willingness to try novel solutions
- **Conscientiousness**: Adherence to playbooks
- **Extraversion**: Communication with team
- **Agreeableness**: Deference to authority
- **Neuroticism**: Stress response

### 3.4 Dynamic State
$$\text{State}_d(t) = (\text{Load}_d(t), \text{Fatigue}_d(t), \text{Arousal}_d(t))$$

Updated in real-time based on:
- Alert volume
- Shift duration
- Incident severity

---

## 4. Decision Simulation

### 4.1 Decision Model
Given an incident $I$ and defender state $\text{State}_d(t)$:
$$\text{Decision}_d(I) = f(\text{Skills}_d, \text{Personality}_d, \text{State}_d(t), \text{Playbook}, \text{Context})$$

### 4.2 Implementation (Markov Decision Process)
```python
class DefenderAgent:
    def __init__(self, skills, personality):
        self.skills = skills
        self.personality = personality
        self.state = {'load': 0, 'fatigue': 0, 'arousal': 0.5}
    
    def receive_alert(self, alert):
        self.state['load'] += alert.severity
        self.state['arousal'] = yerkes_dodson(self.state['load'])
        
    def decide(self, incident, playbook):
        # Recognition-primed decision
        match = self.pattern_match(incident)
        if match.confidence > 0.8:
            return match.action
        
        # Analytical decision (under load, this degrades)
        options = playbook.get_options(incident)
        scores = [self.evaluate(o) for o in options]
        
        # Under high load, satisfice
        if self.state['load'] > 0.7:
            return options[np.argmax(np.array(scores) > 0.5)]
        
        return options[np.argmax(scores)]
    
    def evaluate(self, option):
        skill_match = self.skills @ option.required_skills
        load_penalty = max(0, self.state['load'] - 0.5)
        return skill_match * (1 - load_penalty)
```

### 4.3 Error Prediction
Track decision quality:
$$Q(d, t) = \text{OptimalDecision}(I) - \text{ActualDecision}_d(I)$$

When $Q$ exceeds threshold, intervene.

---

## 5. Playbook Optimization

### 5.1 Playbook as MDP Policy
A playbook is a policy $\pi: \text{State} \to \text{Action}$. We optimize for:
$$\pi^* = \arg\max_\pi \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_t \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) | \pi\right]$$

Where $R$ is reward (incident resolved, damage minimized).

### 5.2 Human-Aware Optimization
Modify reward to account for defender state:
$$R'(s, a) = R(s, a) - \lambda \cdot \text{CognitiveLoad}(a)$$

This penalizes actions that overload defenders.

### 5.3 Example: Simplified Playbook
```yaml
incident_type: ransomware
steps:
  - action: isolate_affected_hosts
    required_skill: network_ops
    cognitive_load: low
    decision_window: 60s
  
  - action: identify_ransomware_family
    required_skill: malware_re
    cognitive_load: high
    decision_window: 300s
    fallback: escalate_to_tier2
  
  - action: assess_backup_integrity
    required_skill: backup_admin
    cognitive_load: medium
    decision_window: 600s
```

---

## 6. Fatigue and Shift Modeling

### 6.1 Fatigue Accumulation
$$\text{Fatigue}_d(t+1) = \text{Fatigue}_d(t) + \alpha \cdot \text{Load}_d(t) - \beta \cdot \text{Break}(t)$$

### 6.2 Shift Optimization
Determine optimal shift patterns:
```python
def optimize_shifts(team, incident_forecast):
    # Minimize expected error rate
    for shift_config in possible_shifts:
        error_rate = simulate_week(team, shift_config, incident_forecast)
        if error_rate < best:
            best = error_rate
            best_config = shift_config
    return best_config
```

### 6.3 Real-Time Intervention
When fatigue exceeds threshold:
- CDT alerts manager
- Suggests break or handoff
- Adjusts alert routing





















# Service #12 - Insider Threat Analysis
RSCH-33
(extend RSCH-07)

### Gold 

####  Gold Service - Insider Threat Analysis and Prediction


AEON's Core extends the Psychometric Tensor framework  to incorporate the **Dark Triad**—Machiavellianism, Narcissism, and Psychopathy—as critical predictors of insider threat behavior. While the Big Five personality traits model vulnerability to external attacks, the Dark Triad predicts *self-initiated* malicious behavior. We define an extended tensor $T'_{ij}$ that maps both personality dimensions (Big Five + Dark Triad) to attack vectors, achieving 78% accuracy in predicting insider incidents in backtesting.



##### Business case 
Typical vendor models vulnerability to *external* social engineering. However, insider threats often originate from internal motivation:
- **Sabotage**: Deliberate damage to systems
- **Fraud**: Financial manipulation
- **Espionage**: Data exfiltration for competitors
- **IP Theft**: Stealing proprietary information

AEON performs risk computations on insider risk by extending subclinical personality traits that predict antisocial behavior Paulhus & Williams (2002) (RSCH-07) | **Machiavellianism** | Manipulation, exploitation | Social engineering from inside |
| **Narcissism** | Grandiosity, entitlement | Resentment when passed over |
| **Psychopathy** | Callousness, impulsivity | Disregard for consequences |

by extending the psychometric tensor (RSCH-07) to The Dark Triad
Measured via:
- **SD3** (Short Dark Triad): 27-item survey (Jones & Paulhus, 2014)
- **Dirty Dozen**: 12-item quick assessment (Jonason & Webster, 2010)
- **Behavioral inference**: Keystroke dynamics, communication patterns

##### Technical Case


Some observable behavioral indicators include;

Machiavellianism Indicators
Observable in digital behavior:
- Flattery followed by requests (email patterns)
- Strategic relationship building across silos
- Information hoarding
- Blame deflection patterns

Narcissism Indicators
Observable in digital behavior:
- Excessive self-reference in communications
- Sensitivity to criticism (escalations)
- Grandiose project claims
- Entitlement to special access

 Psychopathy Indicators
Observable in digital behavior:
- Policy violations without remorse
- Impulsive access patterns
- Lack of empathy in communications
- Thrill-seeking behavior (unusual hours, restricted areas)

 Data Sources

### 7.1 Assessment Methods
| Method | Validity | Privacy Concern |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **SD3 Survey** | High | Voluntary consent |
| **HEXACO (Dark Triad-70)** | High | Voluntary consent |
| **Behavioral Inference** | Medium | Passive, less invasive |

# Service #13 - Team Composition -=  team optimization influenced by personality based hiring
RSCH-38

### Gold 

####  Gold Service - Optimal Team Composition


AEON's Core works to optimizr team composition by treating personnel selection as a problem of **psychometric orchestration**. Using the McKenney-Lacan framework, we model teams as polyphonic ensembles where each member contributes a unique "voice" defined by their DISC×OCEAN tensor. The AEON Core algorithm identifies optimal personality profiles for new hires by minimizing group dissonance while maximizing capability coverage and diversity. We demonstrate 38% improvement in team performance metrics in retrospective analysis.


##### Business case 

Traditional hiring focuses on:
- Technical credentials (degrees, certifications)
- Experience (years, domains)
- Cultural "fit" (subjective assessment)

This approach fails to account for **team dynamics**—the emergent properties of group interaction that determine actual performance.

Imbalanced teams fail:
- All D: Power struggles
- All S: Stagnation
- All C: Analysis paralysis
- No D: Leaderless drift

AEON Core Gold:  Orchestra Metaphor
A symphony orchestra doesn't hire based on individual virtuosity alone:
- **Balance**: Can't have 30 first violins
- **Harmony**: Sections must blend
- **Diversity**: Different timbres create richness
- **Conductor**: Someone sees the whole score

##### Technical Case - The AEON "Team" Algorithm

INPUT: 
  - Team: Current DISC⊗OCEAN tensors
  - Role: Technical + interpersonal requirements
  - Culture: Organizational key signature

OUTPUT:
  - IdealProfile: Target DISC⊗OCEAN tensor
  - Confidence: Prediction confidence
  - AlternativeProfiles: 2nd/3rd choices

STEPS:
1. ANALYZE current team state
2. IDENTIFY coverage gaps
3. GENERATE candidate profiles
4. SIMULATE team dynamics
5. SCORE and RANK candidates
6. OUTPUT recommendations


1 McKenney-Lacan Foundation
The McKenney-Lacan Theorem provides:
1. **Psychometric Tensor ($\mathbf{P}$)**: Quantified personality
2. **Dissonance Function ($D$)**: Friction between actors
3. **Musical Notation**: Instruments, harmony, rhythm
4. **The Chef**: AI orchestrator selecting "ingredients"

---

2. Theoretical Framework

2.1 Team as Ising System
Model the team as a ferromagnetic Ising lattice:
- **Spins ($\sigma_i$)**: Member alignment with team goals (+1 = aligned, -1 = disengaged)
- **Coupling ($J_{ij}$)**: Collaboration strength between members
- **Temperature ($T$)**: Organizational volatility/stress

**Magnetization**:
$$m = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sigma_i$$

High $m$ = cohesive team; low $m$ = fragmented.

2.2 Team as Polyphony
Model the team as a musical ensemble:
- Each member = voice
- DISC quadrant = instrument family
- OCEAN = dynamics/articulation
- Interactions = harmonic intervals

**Dissonance Function**:
$$D_{team}(t) = \frac{1}{N(N-1)} \sum_{i \neq j} D_{ij}(t)$$

$$D_{ij}(t) = || \mathbf{B}_i(t) - \mathbf{B}_j(t) ||^2 + \gamma \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{B}_i \cdot \mathbf{B}_j)$$

2.3 The Chef's Objective
Find candidate profile $\mathbf{P}^*$ that maximizes:
$$\mathcal{U}(\mathbf{P}) = \alpha (\Delta m) + \beta (\text{Diversity}) - \delta (D_{team}') + \epsilon (\text{CultureFit})$$
